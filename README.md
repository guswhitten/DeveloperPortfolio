This site was created to display a few skills/projects of mine related to software/web development. Each page contains a "Contact" section at the bottom which forwards comments, questions, etc. to my personal email.
The homepage features a high-level overview of my background and software-related skills/knowledge. It then contains sections for motivational quotes from a few of my esteemed role models, as well as (for fun) a few TV shows/movies I'm currently interested in. 
The projects page contains screenshots of some of my more prominent projects along with a primitive 'filter' feature for navigating/viewing only the single project of interest.
#####Future fixes:
- Add remaining project photos
- Add description/overview of each project as first "card" in series of images

Finally, the arcade page contains a few simple games made mostly using JavaScript. 
#####Future fixes:
- Finish breakout. Very buggy/incomplete and requires much improvement. 
- Add more description of the rules of the game, algorithm, or method of construction.
